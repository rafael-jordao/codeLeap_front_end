# CodeLeap - Engineering Test 🤖
This project was developed for the Front-end Developer test for CodeLeap.
## Vite 🔽

I decided to use Vite to develop this project because I didn't find it necessary to use any additional framework due to the simplicity of the project.

I know that the new React documentation recommends using Next or Gatsby, however Vite is still a great alternative if you know what you're doing.

## Instructions

To run the App, use the script:

```bash
yarn dev
```
```bash
npm run dev
```

To compile the code into JavaScript, use the script:

```bash
yarn build
```
```bash
npm run build
```

Now we have a dist folder with the bundle of our project. To run it, run the command:

```bash
yarn preview
```

```bash
npm run preview
```
